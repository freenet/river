# River Coding Conventions

- Keep files relatively short, ideally less than 200 lines.
- Organize files top-down, public and highest level functions / structs first, lower-level and private last
- Do not use foo/mod.rs, instead use foo.rs, in other words use the Rust "flat style" for modules.
- If you're having weird rsx issues ask to read https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guide/rsx/ and https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/essentials/rsx/#

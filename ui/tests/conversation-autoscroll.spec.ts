// Regression tests for freenet/river#486: new messages arrived and the view
// did not follow them.
//
// It looked intermittent. It is a permanent latch. Auto-scroll was gated on an
// IntersectionObserver watching a 1px sentinel with a 100px `rootMargin`, which
// answers "is the end of the history on screen right now?" — not "was the
// reader following the conversation". Once the gap passed 100px the gate read
// false and nothing re-armed it short of a manual scroll back down or a room
// switch. On the live Freenet room that meant 54 arrivals with the view frozen
// while the gap ratcheted from 147px to 2725px.
//
// Two things have to hold, and a suite that only checked the first would pass a
// "pin is always true" implementation that yanks the reader back down every
// time they try to read history:
//
//   1. anything that pushes the view off the bottom WITHOUT the reader asking
//      must not stop the view following new messages;
//   2. the reader scrolling away MUST stop it, and their coming back MUST start
//      it again.
//
// Which test carries which is worth stating, because the two groups fail for
// different reasons and only the first group fails against the unfixed code:
//
//   * `keeps following...`, `follows a mid-list insert...` and `keeps the
//     newest message in view when a resize reflows...` are the #486 tests. Each
//     fails against the pre-fix code at its own assertion.
//   * `respects the reader...`, `respects a reader scroll that produces no
//     gesture event` and `does not drag a parked reader down...` are the
//     opposite guard. They constrain the FIX, not the bug: the pre-fix code
//     also refuses to scroll a parked reader (for the wrong reason — its gate
//     has latched), so a revert makes them fail at their setup rather than at
//     the assertion that matters. Their teeth are against a wrong fix, and that
//     is established by mutating the fix, not by reverting it.
//
// Assumes the example-data build, which exposes `window.__riverTest` for
// delivering INBOUND messages. Sending through the composer would prove
// nothing: that path raises `force_scroll`, deliberately bypassing the pin.

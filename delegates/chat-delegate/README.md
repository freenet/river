# ChatDelegate Overview

The ChatDelegate is a key-value storage system for chat applications in Freenet. Let me walk through how it handles different types of messages and the overall flow of operations.

## Overview

The ChatDelegate provides four main operations:
1. **Store** - Save data with a specific key
2. **Get** - Retrieve data for a key
3. **Delete** - Remove data for a key
4. **List** - Get all available keys

Each operation involves a multi-step process due to the asynchronous nature of the delegate system.

## Message Flow Architecture

The delegate uses a state machine pattern where:
1. Initial application messages trigger operations
2. State is stored in a context object between operations
3. Responses from the storage system trigger follow-up actions

## Processing Inbound Messages

The entry point is the `process` method in `lib.rs`, which handles four types of messages:

```rust
match message {
    InboundDelegateMsg::ApplicationMessage(app_msg) => {
        // Handle client requests (Store/Get/Delete/List)
        handle_application_message(app_msg, &origin)
    }
    InboundDelegateMsg::GetSecretResponse(response) => {
        // Handle responses from the storage system
        handle_get_secret_response(response)
    }
    InboundDelegateMsg::UserResponse(_) => {
        // Not used in this delegate
        Ok(vec![])
    }
    InboundDelegateMsg::GetSecretRequest(_) => {
        // Not handled directly
        Err(DelegateError::Other("unexpected message type: get secret request".into()))
    }
}
```

## Key Concepts

Before diving into specific flows, let's understand some key concepts:

1. **Origin**: The contract ID that identifies the application
2. **ChatDelegateKey**: A wrapper around a byte vector that represents a key
3. **KeyIndex**: A list of all keys for a specific origin
4. **PendingOperation**: State stored in the context to track ongoing operations

## 1. Store Operation Flow

When a client wants to store data:

1. **Client sends a StoreRequest**:
   ```rust
   ChatDelegateRequestMsg::StoreRequest { key, value }
   ```

2. **Delegate processes the request** (`handle_store_request`):
    - Creates a unique storage key by combining the origin and client key
    - Stores the operation in context for later processing
    - Immediately sends back a success response to the client
    - Sends a request to store the actual value
    - Requests the current key index to update it

3. **Delegate receives the key index** (`handle_key_index_response`):
    - Adds the new key to the index if it doesn't exist
    - Updates the index in storage
    - The operation is complete

## 2. Get Operation Flow

When a client wants to retrieve data:

1. **Client sends a GetRequest**:
   ```rust
   ChatDelegateRequestMsg::GetRequest { key }
   ```

2. **Delegate processes the request** (`handle_get_request`):
    - Creates the unique storage key
    - Stores the operation in context
    - Sends a request to get the value from storage

3. **Delegate receives the value** (`handle_regular_get_response`):
    - Retrieves the pending operation from context
    - Sends the value back to the client
    - The operation is complete

## 3. Delete Operation Flow

When a client wants to delete data:

1. **Client sends a DeleteRequest**:
   ```rust
   ChatDelegateRequestMsg::DeleteRequest { key }
   ```

2. **Delegate processes the request** (`handle_delete_request`):
    - Creates the unique storage key
    - Stores the operation in context
    - Immediately sends back a success response to the client
    - Sends a request to delete the value (by setting it to None)
    - Requests the current key index to update it

3. **Delegate receives the key index** (`handle_key_index_response`):
    - Removes the key from the index
    - Updates the index in storage
    - The operation is complete

## 4. List Operation Flow

When a client wants to list all keys:

1. **Client sends a ListRequest**:
   ```rust
   ChatDelegateRequestMsg::ListRequest
   ```

2. **Delegate processes the request** (`handle_list_request`):
    - Stores the operation in context
    - Requests the current key index

3. **Delegate receives the key index** (`handle_key_index_response`):
    - Sends the list of keys back to the client
    - The operation is complete

## Key Management

A critical aspect of the delegate is how it manages keys:

1. **Key Namespacing**: Each key is prefixed with the origin to prevent collisions between different applications:
   ```rust
   pub(crate) fn create_origin_key(origin: &Origin, key: &ChatDelegateKey) -> SecretsId {
       SecretsId::new(
           format!("{}{}{}", origin.to_b58(), ORIGIN_KEY_SEPARATOR, 
                  String::from_utf8_lossy(key.as_bytes()).to_string()).into_bytes()
       )
   }
   ```

2. **Key Index**: Each origin has a special key that stores an index of all keys:
   ```rust
   pub(crate) fn create_index_key(origin: &Origin) -> SecretsId {
       SecretsId::new(format!(
           "{}{}{}",
           origin.to_b58(),
           ORIGIN_KEY_SEPARATOR,
           KEY_INDEX_SUFFIX
       ).into_bytes())
   }
   ```

## Context Management

The delegate uses a context object to maintain state between operations:

```rust
pub(super) struct ChatDelegateContext {
    pub(super) pending_ops: HashMap<SecretIdKey, PendingOperation>,
}
```

This context is serialized and passed along with requests, then deserialized when responses are received.

## Tying It All Together

The overall flow for any operation follows this pattern:

1. **Client Request**: Application sends a request to the delegate
2. **Initial Processing**: Delegate creates necessary storage keys and stores state in context
3. **Storage Operations**: Delegate interacts with the storage system
4. **Response Handling**: Delegate processes storage responses and updates state
5. **Client Response**: Delegate sends final response back to the application

This asynchronous, multi-step approach allows the delegate to maintain consistency while providing a simple interface to client applications.

## Example: Complete Store Flow

Let's trace a complete store operation:

1. Client sends `StoreRequest { key: "user123", value: [profile data] }`
2. Delegate:
    - Creates storage key: `[origin]:user123`
    - Creates index key: `[origin]::key_index`
    - Stores pending operation in context
    - Sends success response to client
    - Sends request to store value at `[origin]:user123`
    - Sends request to get current index at `[origin]::key_index`
3. Delegate receives index (or empty if first key)
4. Delegate:
    - Adds "user123" to index if not present
    - Updates index in storage
    - Operation complete

This architecture ensures data consistency while providing a responsive experience for client applications.
